OAuth is an authorization framework used to identify and authenticate users for an application. There are a number of implementation misconfigurations which can lead to an OAuth framework being implemented insecurely.

During the OAuth based account registration process, the OAuth authorization flow creates a new account for an email address and grants access via an OAuth token without checking if there is a pre-existing account for the same email address. This allows an attacker to register an account with a legitimate email and “squat” on the account. When the legitimate user creates an account with their email address using the OAuth workflow, they are unknowingly logged into the original account that the attacker created. This means that the attacker is still able to access the account.

An advanced attacker can leverage a missing `X-XSS-Protection` header to bypass security controls of an application to execute code within a user's browser.

**Business Impact**

Not having a `X-XSS-Protection` header can lead to reputational damage and indirect financial loss to the business due to an advanced attacker’s ability to access data through a XSS attack. The degree of impact is dependent on the sensitivity of data being stored and transmitted by the application, and the sophistication of the attacker’s abilities.

**Steps to Reproduce**

1. Enable a HTTP interception proxy, such as Burp Suite or OWASP ZAP
1. Navigate to the following endpoint using a browser: {{URL}}
1. Capture the request using the HTTP interception proxy and review the response
1. Observe that no `X-XSS-Protection` header is implemented within the HTTP headers

**Proof of Concept (PoC)**

The screenshot below demonstrates the missing header:

{{screenshot}}

## Resolution
The `X-XSS-Protection` header should not be used in modern browsers as it can create XSS vulnerabilities in websites. It has been deprecated by the Content Security Policy (CSP) security header. The CSP header, `Content-Security-Policy`, should be used to prevent XSS attacks.

The `Content-Security-Policy` header should be configured in a way that reduces the attack surface of the application. The CSP header is not set as a catch-all, due to its permissive design. Therefore, It is important to ensure that the CSP heading is not too permissive for the application's needs, and has directives appropriately set.

For older browsers that do not support the CSP header, the `X-XSS-Protection` header should be set to instruct browsers how to filter and block XSS attacks. For example:

`X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block`

This directive enables XSS filtering then prevents rendering of the web page if a XXS attack is detected.","https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/X-XSS-Protection, https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CSP, https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Content-Security-Policy"
Server Security Misconfiguration - Lack of Security Headers - X-Frame-Options,info,,,"## Description
A lack of the HTTP response header for `X-Frame-Options` can lead to sensitive user data being retrieved by an attacker. There are multiple HTTP response headers used in communication between the server and client which can be implemented to improve security against well documented vulnerabilities. For example, the `X-Frame-Options` security header is used to instruct a browser whether it should or should not render an `<iframe>`, `<frame>`, `<embed>`, or `<object>` tag.

An advanced attacker can leverage a missing `X-Frame-Options` header to render an `<iframe>`, `<frame>`, `<embed>`, or `<object>` tag to bypass Same Origin Policy (SOP) and read data, or to exploit a click-jacking attack.

**Business Impact**

Not having an `X-Frame-Options` header can lead to reputational damage and indirect financial loss to the business due to an advanced attacker’s ability to access data through a click-jacking attack, or via bypassing the SOP. The degree of impact is dependent on the sensitivity of data being transmitted over the wire and the sophistication of the attacker’s abilities.

**Steps to Reproduce**

1. Enable a HTTP interception proxy, such as Burp Suite or OWASP ZAP
1. Navigate to the following endpoint using a browser: {{URL}}

1. Observe that no `X-Frame-Options` header is implemented within the HTTP headers

**Proof of Concept (PoC)**

The screenshot below demonstrates the missing header:

{{screenshot}}

## Resolution
The `x-frame-options` header should be set to instruct browsers how to handle framing from other domains. The following directives can be used:

- **DENY** - This directive prevents all attempts of a page being displayed in a frame. For example:

    `X-Frame-Options: DENY`

- **SAMEORIGIN** - This directive allows the page to be displayed in a frame only if it originates from the same origin as the page itself. For example:

    `X-Frame-Options: SAMEORIGIN`",
Server Security Misconfiguration - Lack of Security Headers - Strict-Transport-Security,info,,,"## Description
A lack of the HTTP response header for Strict Transport Security can lead to sensitive data being transmitted unencrypted and being intercepted while in transit. There are multiple HTTP response headers used in communication between the server and client which can be implemented to improve security against well documented vulnerabilities. For example, the HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS) header instructs the website to enforce the use of HTTPS.

By not having a HSTS header in place, the application fails to enforce users to connect to it over an encrypted connection. If an advanced attacker is positioned to intercept or modify a user’s network traffic, they can perform a protocol downgrade attack, a Persons-in-the-Middle (PitM) attack, or hijack a user’s cookies. This aids an advanced attacker in gaining access to the data being sent between the server and client, including the login credentials or application cookies.

**Business Impact**

Not having a HSTS header can lead to reputational damage and indirect financial loss to the business due to an advanced attacker’s access to data over an unencrypted HTTP connection. The degree of impact is dependent on the sensitivity of data being transmitted over the wire.

**Steps to Reproduce**

1. Enable a HTTP interception proxy, such as Burp Suite or OWASP ZAP
1. Navigate to the following endpoint using a browser: {{URL}}
1. Capture the request using the HTTP interception proxy
1. Observe that a HSTS header is not in the response of the HTTP request

**Proof of Concept (PoC)**

The screenshot below demonstrates a lack of HSTS header:

{{screenshot}}

## Resolution
The `Strict-Transport-Security` header should be set to instruct browsers that sites should only be accessed over a HTTPS connection. For example:

`Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=<31536000>`

Here `max-age` is set for a year, measured in seconds. It is recommended that this be set to a large value such as 1 or 2 years. Additionally, the optional directive of `includeSubDomains` can be used to include all subdomains.

Server Security Misconfiguration - Fingerprinting/Banner Disclosure,info,,,"## Description
Fingerprinting is where an attacker identifies the services running on a host due to visible default banners. This information helps an attacker to formulate a list of applicable exploits on a target system.

The application responds with a banner disclosing the type and version of the web server being run. From this information an attacker can determine if the application is vulnerable to known vulnerabilities. Older versions of servers are particularly susceptible to known, version-specific attacks if they do not have up-to-date security patches.

**Business Impact**

Banner disclosures can lead to reputational damage for the business due to a loss in confidence from users who can see that the web server is running on older software. If an attacker is successful in identifying and exploiting a known vulnerability for the identified version of software on this host, this can lead to indirect financial losses and data loss.

**Steps to Reproduce**

1. Enable a HTTP interception proxy, such as Burp Suite or OWASP ZAP
1. Use a browser to navigate to: {{URL}}

Server Security Misconfiguration - Cache Deception,unclassified,,,"## Description
Cache deception allows an attacker to serve fake static files, forcing the web server to mistakenly cache and serve dynamic content as though it were static. If subsequent users make requests to the same URL, they are served the cached page. This can lead to sensitive data exposure for multiple users across different sessions.

**Business Impact**

This vulnerability can lead to reputational damage and indirect financial loss to the company through the impact to customers’ trust.

**Steps to Reproduce**

1. Enable a HTTP interception proxy, such as Burp Suite or OWASP ZAP

```

1. Notice that the following page is cached: {{screenshot}}
1. Perform {{action}} to demonstrate cache deception

**Proof of Concept (PoC)**

The screenshot(s) below demonstrate(s) this vulnerability:

{{screenshot}}

## Resolution
The most effective way to prevent cache deception is to carefully control which responses are cached and to avoid caching responses that contain user-specific or sensitive data.

Ensure that authentication-protected pages and any responses containing sensitive information explicitly disable caching via headers such as `Cache-Control: no-store, no-cache, must-revalidate` and `Pragma: no-cache`.

Be particularly cautious with URL structures. Cache deception attacks often rely on tricking the cache into treating dynamic responses as static. A simple mitigation is to ensure that URLs ending in extensions like `.css`, `.js`, `.png`, etc., only serve static content and do not process dynamic requests.

For additional protection, configure your cache layer to only cache responses from a predefined allowlist of safe URL patterns. This prevents attackers from injecting deceptive paths that lead to cached sensitive data.

Auditing your cache behavior using tools like Param Miner or manual testing can help identify and eliminate unintended caching of sensitive responses. Additionally, security headers such as `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff` can help prevent certain forms of cache-related attacks.

Finally, if your application uses a CDN or a reverse proxy (e.g., Cloudflare, Akamai, Varnish), ensure that caching rules are correctly configured to prevent caching of personalized or user-specific content.",

Self-reflected XSS can be found on this domain which allows an attacker to create crafted JavaScript payload. Additionally, the attacker needs to socially engineer the user to paste the JavaScript payload into the user’s browser. If successful, the JavaScript will execute temporarily within that user’s browser in the context of the domain.

When an attacker can control code that is executed within a user’s browser, they are able to carry out any actions that the user is able to perform, including accessing any of the user's data and modifying information within the user’s permissions. This can result in modification, deletion, or theft of data, including accessing or deleting files, or stealing session cookies which an attacker could use to hijack a user’s session.

**Business Impact**

Self-reflected XSS could lead to data theft through the attacker’s ability to manipulate data through their access to the application, and their ability to interact with other users, including performing other malicious attacks, which would appear to originate from a legitimate user. These malicious actions could also result in reputational damage for the business through the impact to customers’ trust.

**Steps to Reproduce**

1. Use a browser to navigate to: {{URL}}
1. Log in as a user
1. Insert the following JavaScript payload:

```JavaScript
{{payload}}
```

1. Observe the JavaScript payload being executed

## Resolution
# Recommendations

All user input fields should be validated and sanitized based on what the field is likely to contain. For example, a date of birth field should only contain a maximum of 10 characters consisting of numbers and forward slashes. Drop down or pick lists can be used for allowable inputs to ensure expected values are sent to the server. Similarly, output encoding should be used to properly escape user input and dynamic content when it is displayed on a page.

Additionally, use appropriate HTTP response headers to ensure the browser correctly interprets responses. For example:

``` HTTP

 x-content-type-options: nosniff
 Content-Security-Policy: default-src ‘self’; script-src ‘self’

Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) - Reflected - Non-Self,medium,,,"## Description
Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) is a type of injection attack where malicious JavaScript code is injected into a website. When a user visits the affected web page, the JavaScript code executes and its input is reflected in the user's browser. Reflected XSS can be found on this domain which allows an attacker to create a crafted URL which when opened by a user will execute arbitrary JavaScript within that user's browser in the context of this domain.

When an attacker can control code that is executed within a user’s browser, they are able to carry out any actions that the user is able to perform, including accessing any of the user's data and modifying information within the user’s permissions. This can result in modification, deletion, or theft of data, including accessing or deleting files, or stealing session cookies which an attacker could use to hijack a user’s session.

## Resolution
There is no single technique to stop XSS from occurring. However, implementing the right combination of defensive measures within the application will prevent and limit the impact of XSS. Some best practices include the following:

Where sources of information (input) are available, input should be sanitised to ensure only the desired information (and no special characters, or HTML) are being stored.  All user input fields should be sanitized based on what the field is likely to contain. For example, a date field `(01/01/2001)` should be stored using the appropriate data type, and not in a string based format.

Additionally, where sinks of information (output) are being presented in the application, the output should be appropriately encoded to ensure that HTML or Javascript isn't able to be rendered, should it have been stored via an input source.

It is also best practice to use appropriate HTTP response headers to ensure the browser correctly interprets responses. These should be customized specific to the application, and its environment. For example:

```
X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
Content-Security-Policy: default-src ‘self’; script-src ‘self’

Server-Side Injection - Remote Code Execution (RCE),critical,,,"## Description
Remote Code Execution (RCE) is a vulnerability that allows commands to be executed remotely on a target machine by crafting a request within the application where there should be no context to access or execute code.

A RCE vulnerability in this application allows a malicious attacker to remotely execute code on the server, enabling an attacker to extract passwords, reconfigure running services, move laterally into attached networks, and potentially take over the server.

**Business Impact**

RCE could lead to data theft through the attacker's ability to manipulate data through their access to the application server. These malicious actions could also result in reputational damage for the business through the impact to customers' trust.

**Steps to Reproduce**

Example:

1. Using a Machine with access to `curl`, run the command `curl {{url}}/cmd?=ping%20192.168.1.1;cat%20/etc/hostname`
1. In the terminal, you will see the output of the ping command, then the hostname of the server hosting this website.

#### Proof of Concept

The screenshot below demonstrates the RCE in the application through the specified parameter:

Server-Side Injection - LDAP Injection,unclassified,,,"## Description
LDAP injection is an attack used to exploit web based applications that construct LDAP statements based on user input. When an application fails to properly sanitize user input, it’s possible to modify LDAP statements using a local proxy. This LDAP injection vulnerability could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary commands, such as granting permissions to unauthorized queries, and content modification inside the LDAP tree. The same advanced exploitation techniques available in SQL injection can be similarly applied in LDAP injection.

**Business Impact**

LDAP injection vulnerabilities can lead to reputational damage through the impact to customers’ trust, or to regulatory fines due to an attacker’s unauthorized access to data. The severity of the impact to the business is dependent on the sensitivity of the data being stored in, and transmitted by the application.

**Steps to Reproduce**

1. Using a browser, log into the webpage: {{URL}}
1. In the request to URI modify the token XYZ by appending a quote ``` and you'll see an error return
1. Replace this with the payload below and you'll see a response indicating an injection occurring:

```
{{payload}}
```

**Proof of Concept (PoC)**

The screenshot(s) below demonstrate(s) the vulnerability:

{{screenshot}}

## Resolution
To prevent LDAP injection attacks, it is recommended to validate all untrusted input. Properly encoding and sanitizing all input in the application layer minimizes the possibilities of the threats posed by LDAP injection. The following secure coding practices are recommended:

- Whitelist input validation
- Escape all variables using the correct encoding functions
- Index fields containing sensitive information, such as user passwords
- Conduct output regulation
- Perform dynamic checks
- Perform static source code analysis

Additionally, it is important to ensure that the LDAP environment is safely configured. Safeguard sensitive information in the LDAP directory by configuring user permissions. This is especially important for directories used for logging purposes on mobile and web applications.",https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/LDAP_Injection_Prevention_Cheat_Sheet.html
Server-Side Injection - SQL Injection,critical,,,"## Description
SQL injection (SQLi) is a vulnerability in which an application accepts input into an SQL statement and treats this input as part of the statement. Typically, SQLi allows a malicious attacker to view, modify or delete data that should not be able to be retrieved. An SQLi vulnerability was found for this host which allows an attacker to execute code and view data from the SQL service by submitting SQL queries.

An attacker could exploit this lack of input sanitization to exfiltrate database data and files, tamper with the data, or perform resource exhaustion. Depending on the database and how it is configured, an attacker could potentially remotely execute code on the server running the database.

**Business Impact**

Data exfiltration through a SQLi attack could lead to reputational damage or regulatory fines for the business due to an attacker’s unauthorized access to data. This could also result in reputational damage for the business through the impact to customers’ trust. The severity of the impact to the business is dependent on the sensitivity of the data being stored in, and transmitted by the application.

**Steps to Reproduce**

1. Using a browser, login to in-scope asset at: {{URL}}
1. Browse to account page
1. Modify ID token to add single quote
1. View error which states 'SQL Syntax Error'
1. Replace ID value with the following payload:

```SQL
{{payload}}
```

**Proof of Concept (PoC)**

The screenshot below demonstrates the SQLi being executed:

{{screenshot}}

The following database name and database user have been retrieved to demonstrate that the PoC exfiltrates valid database information:

{{database name/database user}}

## Resolution
To prevent SQL injection attacks, it is recommended that queries use parameterized queries instead of string concatenation. For example, the following is a good statement:

```SQL
txtUserId = getRequestString(""UserId"");
txtSQL = ""SELECT * FROM Users WHERE UserId = @0"";
```

Whereas the following is a bad statement:

```SQL
txtSQL = ""SELECT * FROM Users WHERE getRequestString(""UserId"") = @0"";
```

Using parameterized queries allows for code and data to be distinguished by the database regardless of input. However, all inputs should go through a validation process which only allows content to be processed by the database if it passes validation.","https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/SQL_Injection_Prevention_Cheat_Sheet.html, https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Query_Parameterization_Cheat_Sheet.html, https://www.w3schools.com/sql/sql_injection.asp"

Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF),unclassified,,,"## Description
Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) occurs when requests to the application are submitted on behalf of an authenticated user without their knowledge via crafted, malicious code which can be in the form of a link the user clicks. The application is unable to distinguish between the malicious request and a legitimate request from the user.

CSRF is possible for this application, allowing an attacker to submit requests to the application on behalf of an authenticated user. Additionally, the attacker needs to socially engineer the user to click on a link, or paste the malicious code into the user’s browser. If successful, the code will execute within that user’s browser in the context of this domain.

When an attacker can control code that is executed within a user’s browser, they are able to carry out any actions that the user is able to perform, including accessing any of the user's data and modifying information within the user’s permissions. This can result in modification, deletion, or theft of data, including accessing or deleting files, or stealing session cookies which an attacker could use to hijack a user’s session. The attacker’s actions are limited by the privileges of the user, as well as the application’s capabilities and the data stored within it.

**Business Impact**

CSRF could lead to data theft through the attacker’s ability to manipulate data through their access to the application, and their ability to interact with other users, including performing other malicious attacks, which would appear to originate from a legitimate user. These malicious actions could also result in reputational damage for the business through the impact to customers’ trust.

**Steps to Reproduce**

1. Enable a HTTP interception proxy, such as Burp Suite or OWASP ZAP
1. Use a browser to sign into the application at: {{URL}}
1. Navigate to the following URL and submit the form: {{URL}}

# Recommendations

A Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) token should be included within all relevant requests. The CSRF token needs to be unpredictable, tied to a user's session, strictly validated before actions are executed, and not be stored within cookies.

CSRF tokens can be used to prevent CSRF attacks by making it near impossible for a malicious attacker to predict and construct a valid HTTP request of a user because they don't know the value of the CSRF token. Therefore, any request that a malicious attacker attempts to construct will not have all of the necessary parameters for the application to validate and execute the request.","https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Cross-Site_Request_Forgery_Prevention_Cheat_Sheet.html, https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Cross-Site_Request_Forgery_Prevention_Cheat_Sheet.html#synchronizer-token-pattern"

The application is unable to distinguish between the malicious request and a legitimate request from the user. Additionally, the attacker needs to socially engineer the user to click on a link, or paste the malicious code into the user’s browser. If successful, the code will execute within that user’s browser in the context of this domain.

Application-wide CSRF is possible for this application, allowing an attacker to submit requests to the application on behalf of an authenticated user on multiple endpoints. This can include changing the password and email associated with the account, or deleting the user account. These actions can severely disrupt a user's experience and lead to account takeover.

**Business Impact**

CSRF could lead to data theft through the attacker’s ability to manipulate data through their access to the application, and their ability to interact with other users, including performing other malicious attacks, which would appear to originate from a legitimate user. These malicious actions could also result in reputational damage for the business through the impact to customers’ trust.

Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) - Flash-Based,info,,,"## Description
Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) occurs when requests to the application are submitted on behalf of an authenticated user without their knowledge via crafted, malicious code which can be in the form of a link the user clicks. The application is unable to distinguish between the malicious request and a legitimate request from the user.

Flash-based CSRF is possible for this application, allowing an attacker to submit requests to the application on behalf of an authenticated user. Additionally, the attacker needs to socially engineer the user to click on a link, or paste the malicious code into the user’s browser. If successful, the code will execute within that user’s browser in the context of this domain.

**Business Impact**

CSRF could lead to data theft through the attacker’s ability to manipulate data through their access to the application, and their ability to interact with other users, including performing other malicious attacks which would appear to originate from a legitimate user. These malicious actions could also result in reputational damage for the business through the impact to customers’ trust.

**Steps to Reproduce**

1. Enable a HTTP interception proxy, such as Burp Suite or OWASP ZAP
1. Modify the request with the following CSRF POC code which uses a `.SWF` file:

```HTML
{{CSRF POC}}
```

 and forward the request to the endpoint:

```http
{{request}}
```

1. Navigate to the following URL and observe within the HTTP interception proxy that the action taken by the CSRF POC code was successful: {{URL}}

Broken Authentication and Session Management,unclassified,,,"## Description
Broken authentication and session management vulnerabilities exist when a user is able to access resources or perform actions not intended for their user role. Identity and access controls can be bypassed through a variety of ways including but not limited to, calling an internal post authentication page, modifying the given URL parameters, by manipulating the form, or by counterfeiting sessions.

This application has authentication and session management controls which an attacker can bypass to access a user account. The attacker is only limited by the permissions of the user account they access, including Administrator users. This could include viewing or editing sensitive customer data, viewing or editing other user permissions, and taking over other user accounts or elevating privileges.

**Business Impact**

Broken authentication and session management could lead to data theft through the attacker’s ability to manipulate data through their access to the application, and their ability to interact with other users, including performing other malicious attacks, which would appear to originate from a legitimate user. These malicious actions could also result in reputational damage for the business through the impact to customers’ trust.

**Steps to Reproduce**

1. Enable a HTTP interception proxy, such as Burp Suite or OWASP ZAP
1. Use a browser to navigate to: {{URL}}
1. Forward the following request to the endpoint:

```http
{{request}}

Broken Authentication and Session Management - Cleartext Transmission of Session Token,low,,,"## Description
Session tokens help a server trust that the requests it is receiving come from a specific authenticated user. When a session token is transmitted in cleartext over an unencrypted channel, it can be intercepted via a Person-in-the-Middle (PitM) attack. This application transmits the session token via a cleartext transmission which can allow an attacker to access the session token via a PitM attack and send requests to the server pretending to be the legitimate user.

**Business Impact**

This vulnerability can lead to reputational damage and indirect financial loss to the company as customers may view the application as insecure. It can also lead to data theft through the attacker’s ability to manipulate data through their ability to make requests to the server through a legitimate session token. However, the attacker is limited by the legitimate user’s privileges within the application/

**Steps to Reproduce**

1. Enable a HTTP interception proxy, such as Burp Suite or OWASP ZAP
1. Use a browser to navigate to: {{URL}}
1. View the HTTP headers using an HTTP interception proxy
1. Observe the `Secure` flag is not set
1. Observe that cookies are sent in cleartext

Weak login function can be remediated by implementing a handful of best practices relating to authentication and session management to ensure secure implementation. These include:

- Enabling HTTPS for the login page and all subsequent authenticated pages
- Disable the option of forcing a HTTP connection by browsers
- Implement the HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS) header
- Keeping all systems, software and operating systems up-to-date with a repeatable patch management process
- Validate all user input server-side
- Ensure that the authentication mechanisms and logic are robust and that each request for a resource passes through an authorization process

The verification logic of the application, as well as all of the above, should be thoroughly tested during the development and QA phases of an application build.

Broken Authentication and Session Management - Weak Login Function,unclassified,,,"## Description
Weak login functionality arises from improperly configured authentication practices which weakens the security of the authentication process of an application. When this application loads the login page over HTTP by default or doesn’t have HTTPS available, all web requests are transmitted over HTTP in plaintext. This allows any attacker on the same network to observe these requests, and obtain the login credentials.

**Business Impact**

Weak login function can lead to indirect financial loss through an attacker accessing login credentials and gain access to the user’s account. From here, the attacker could delete or modify the users data. This could also result in reputational damage for the business through the impact to customers’ trust. The severity of the impact is dependent on the sensitivity of the data being stored in, and transmitted by the application, as well as the privileges of the account the attacker gains access to.

**Steps to Reproduce**

1. Enable a HTTP interception proxy, such as Burp Suite or OWASP ZAP
1. Use a browser to navigate to: {{URL}}
1. Attempt to sign into the website using the login button
1. In the HTTP interception proxy, observe that the credentials are submitted over HTTP by default

Broken Authentication and Session Management - Authentication Bypass,critical,,,"## Description
Authentication bypass vulnerabilities allow an attacker to gain access to an account without having to go through the application's authentication procedure. 

Authentication bypass often occurs through logic flaws and incomplete implementation of authentication mechanisms. Bypassing the authentication mechanisms of this application allows an attacker to view or edit data or other user's permissions, take over user accounts, access unauthorized endpoints, or expose critical data, depending on the authorization of the account they gain access to.

**Business Impact**

Authentication bypass can lead to data loss or theft through an attacker's access to data. The severity of which is dependent on the sensitivity of the data within the application. It can also result in reputational damage to the application or the company due to legitimate users not trusting the security of the application if the application's data becomes publicly available.

**Steps to Reproduce**

1. Navigate to: {{URL}} and log in as a regular user
1. In the URL, change the `/user` to `/user/administrator`
1. Observe that the application now allows the user to view other user's profile details. These actions are usually restricted to an authenticated user

Broken Authentication and Session Management - Second Factor Authentication (2FA) Bypass,medium,,,"## Description
Incorrectly implemented Second Factor Authentication (2FA) mechanisms can be bypassed through manipulation of the form, modifying the given URL parameters, or by counterfeiting the session. The 2FA mechanism for this application can be bypassed by an attacker who can gain access to the application through a user’s account and impersonate users.

The attacker is only limited by the permissions of the user account they access, including Administrator users. This could include viewing or editing sensitive customer data, viewing or editing other user permissions, and taking over other user accounts or elevating privileges.

**Business Impact**

Bypassing 2FA mechanisms could lead to data theft through the attacker’s ability to manipulate data through their access to the application, and their ability to interact with other users, including performing other malicious attacks, which would appear to originate from a legitimate user. These malicious actions could also result in reputational damage for the business through the impact to customers’ trust.

Broken Authentication and Session Management - Failure to Invalidate Session,unclassified,,,"## Description
Failure to invalidate a session is a vulnerability which allows an attacker to maintain access to a service. An attacker can use previously acquired sessions to exploit the privacy of a targeted user by continually accessing their account and gathering information about an application’s endpoints an unauthenticated user will not usually have access to.

An attacker may compromise a user’s session through a variety of ways including, calling an internal post authentication page, modifying the given URL parameters, phishing a user, by manipulating a form, or by counterfeiting sessions. Once they have gained account access, an attacker may be able to change the password of the account and lock out the legitimate user. The attacker’s actions are limited by the privileges of the user’s account that they gain access to. This could include viewing or editing sensitive customer data, viewing or editing other user permissions.

**Business Impact**

This vulnerability can lead to reputational damage and indirect financial loss to the company as customers may view the application as insecure.

**Steps to Reproduce**

1. Sign into a user’s account (Browser A)
1. Sign into the same user’s account, using a different browser (Browser B)
1. Observe that both user sessions are valid

**Proof of Concept (PoC)**

Broken Authentication and Session Management - Failure to Invalidate Session - On Logout (Client and Server-Side),low,,,"## Description
Failure to invalidate a session when a user logs out is a vulnerability that increases the attack surface for session hijacking attacks, such as Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), session sniffing, and other client-side attacks. Most users have the expectation that when they logout, no one else can access their account. When sessions are not invalidated on logout, the user’s trust is broken.

This application fails to invalidate a user’s session server-side on logout, leaving the account vulnerable to session hijacking. An attacker may compromise a user’s session then be able to change the password of the account and lock out the legitimate user. Once the attacker has gained access to an account their actions are only limited by the privileges of the user’s account that they have gained access to. This could include viewing or editing sensitive customer data, viewing or editing other user permissions.

**Business Impact**

This vulnerability can lead to reputational damage and indirect financial loss to the company as customers may view the application as insecure.

Failure to invalidate a session on logout may also lead to data theft through the attacker’s ability to manipulate data through their access to the application, and their ability to interact with other users, including performing other malicious attacks, which would appear to originate from a legitimate user. These malicious actions could also result in reputational damage for the business through the impact to customers’ trust.

**Steps to Reproduce**

1. Enable a HTTP interception proxy, such as Burp Suite or OWASP ZAP
1. Use a browser to navigate to: {{URL}}
1. Sign into a user account
1. In the HTTP interception proxy, capture any authenticated GET or POST request
1. Log out of the user account in the browser
1. In the HTTP interception proxy, resend the captured request to the endpoint:

```http
{{request}}
```

1. Observe that the session token was not invalidated on logout

**Proof of Concept (PoC)**

The screenshot below show the logout occurring and the application failing to invalidate the session:

{{screenshot}}

## Resolution
The application should invalidate all current user sessions, both server-side and client-side, when the user logs out.

As many common user scenarios involve users leaving or closing a page instead of logging out, short session expiration should also be considered for all user sessions. This allows an attacker less time to use a valid session ID. Session timeout values should be set based upon business needs. wThe length of the session should take into consideration the criticality of the application and the data contained within.

## Resolution
At a minimum, all non-current user sessions should be invalidated when the user changes their password. However, it is best practice to invalidate all of a user's sessions upon password reset and have the user login to their account again with the newly created password.

Additionally, short session expiration windows should be considered for all user sessions as they allow an attacker less time to use a valid session ID.

Sensitive Data Exposure - JSON Hijacking,info,,,"## Description
Sensitive data can be exposed when it is not behind an authorization barrier. When this information is exposed it can place the application at further risk of compromise. JSON Hijacking allows a malicious attacker to exfiltrate sensitive data using Cross Site Request Forgery (CSRF) and overriding the Object prototype by using `__defineSetter__`.

This application is susceptible to JSON hijacking which enables an attacker to retrieve sensitive data by tricking a user to click on a crafted link. Once a user clicks on the link, data from the user’s account is read and passed to the attacker. This allows an attacker to collect Personally Identifiable Information (PII) and sensitive metadata to escalate privileges or launch phishing campaigns on targeted users.

**Business Impact**

Sensitive data disclosure through JSON hijacking can result in reputational damage for the business through the impact to customers’ trust. The severity of the impact to the business is dependent on the sensitivity of the data being stored in, and transmitted by the application.

**Steps to Reproduce**

1. Host the following payload on the attacker server:

{{payload}}

1. Make a request on behalf of the user to the attacker served file:

{{screenshot}}

1. Observe that the user requested data from the vulnerable endpoint and the response is in JSON
1. On the attacker hosted server, look at the logs to see that the JSON was successfully exfiltrated:

## Resolution
To prevent JSON hijacking from occurring, the following configurations can be set:

- Sanitize all data inputs both server and client-side.
- Enable CSRF protections by requiring a predefined, random value for all JSON requests
- Only return JSON objects through HTTP POST requests, as script tags will only generate through HTTP GET requests
- Do not let web browsers interpret JSON objects as valid JavaScript code",
Sensitive Data Exposure - Cross Site Script Inclusion (XSSI),unclassified,,,"## Description
Cross-Site Script Inclusion (XSSI) is a client-side attack that uses JavaScript within an authenticated session to leak sensitive data. This sensitive data could be authentication related or user related sensitive data. XSSI can be found on this domain which allows an attacker to control code that is executed within a user’s authenticated session.
  
**Business Impact**

XSSI could lead to data theft and exfiltration through the attacker’s ability to manipulate data. These malicious actions could also result in reputational damage for the business through the impact to customers’ trust.

**Steps to Reproduce**

1. Enable a HTTP interception proxy, such as Burp Suite or OWASP ZAP
1. Use a browser to navigate to: {{URL}}
1. Forward the following request to the endpoint:

```http
{{request}}
```

1. Log into an account and navigate to URL which contains the payload
1. Observe the JavaScript payload being executed

**Proof of Concept (PoC)**

Below is a screenshot demonstrating the injected JavaScript executing:

{{screenshot}}

## Resolution
There is no single technique to stop XSS from occurring. However, implementing the right combination of defensive measures within the application will prevent and limit the impact of XSS. Some best practices include the following:

All user input fields should be sanitized based on what the field is likely to contain. For example, a date field (01/01/2001) should only contain a maximum of 10 characters consisting of numbers and forward slashes. Additionally, drop down or pick lists can be used for allowable inputs to ensure expected values are sent to the server.
Use appropriate HTTP response headers to ensure the browser correctly interprets responses. These should be customized specific to the application and its environment. For example:

``` HTTP
X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
Content-Security-Policy: default-src ‘self’; script-src ‘self’

## Resolution
There are a number of best practices involved with implementing strong access controls, including the following:

- Declare the type of access allowed for each resource and deny access by default, unless these specific access conditions are met by a user attempting to access the resource. To enforce these access controls, it’s important to use a single application wide mechanism.
- It is recommended that all critical information is stored server-side, with only a session ID being passed back and forth between the server and client.
- Similarly, the data being sent to the client should be encrypted to ensure that data cannot be viewed in transit, and it should be digitally signed to ensure the data's integrity.
- Thoroughly test and audit the access controls during the development and deployment lifecycle to ensure the security and integrity of the controls.

Broken Access Control (BAC) - Exposed Sensitive iOS URL Scheme,unclassified,,,"## Description
A URL Scheme helps facilitate the transfer of a limited amount of data between iOS applications on Apple mobile devices. iOS applications operate in separate sandboxes to limit the access and transfer of data between applications. However, it is possible to perform an App-in-the-Middle (AitM) attack where a malicious application sends a manipulated URL Scheme to trick a legitimate application into sharing a user’s sensitive data, bypassing access controls of the legitimate application.

The application has an exposed sensitive iOS URL Scheme, which an attacker can take advantage of to perform an AitM attack, bypass the access controls of the application, and gather sensitive user data. This data could be used to perform further attacks on the application, the business, or its users, including account takeover.

**Business Impact**

This vulnerability can lead to reputational damage and indirect financial loss to the company through the impact to customers’ trust. The severity of the impact to the business is dependent on the sensitivity of the accessible data being transmitted by the application.

**Steps to Reproduce**

1. Enable a HTTP interception proxy, such as Burp Suite or OWASP ZAP
1. Use a browser to navigate to: {{URL}}
1. Log in to an account that should not be able to perform {{action}}
1. Forward the following request to the endpoint:

```http

## Resolution
Broken access controls can be remediated by implementing a handful of best practices relating to authentication and session management to ensure secure implementation. These include:

- Ensuring that access controls are designed thoroughly upfront and that each request goes through some form of access control check. By default, specific requests that are not explicitly allowed should be denied.
- All users, programs and processes should follow the principle of least privilege and only be given as little access as possible in order to complete their business functions.
- An application’s code should not contain any hardcoded roles as these can become fragile and difficult to enforce and audit.","https://owasp.org/www-project-proactive-controls/v3/en/c7-enforce-access-controls, https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/200.html, https://portswigger.net/web-security/access-control"

An attacker can use this vulnerability to bypass Same Origin Policy and execute scripts on domains outside of the scope allowing for code execution and sensitive data exfiltration about end users, including credentials.

**Business Impact**

Rosetta flash can lead to reputational damage for the business due to a loss in confidence and trust by users. A successful rosetta flash attack can lead to sensitive data exfiltration which can result in indirect financial loss to the business.

**Steps to Reproduce**

1. Enable a HTTP interception proxy, such as Burp Suite or OWASP ZAP
1. Navigate to callback endpoint: {{value}}
1. {{action}} and intercept request with a Web Proxy
1. Notice the SWF used: {{value}}
1. Use {{software}} to generate an alphanumeric SWF file hosted on the attacker website: {{value}}
1. Use the callback endpoint to {{action}}

**Proof of Concept (PoC)**

The screenshot(s) below demonstrates the full exploit:

## Resolution
All software should be kept up to date and routinely managed through a patch management process. It is important to have an inventory of all software and versions in use, including dependencies. Regular monitoring of the Common Vulnerability and Exposures (CVE) and National Vulnerability Database (NVD) is also recommended.

Flash files cannot start with comments. Therefore, ensuring that `callback` parameters begin with a comment, such as `/* */`, can protect against rosetta flash.",

Unvalidated Redirects and Forwards,unclassified,,,"## Description
Unvalidated redirects and forwards occur when an application accepts user input that is not validated into the target of a redirection. This input causes a redirection to an external domain, manipulating a user by redirecting them to a malicious site. An open redirect was identified which can impact users' ability to trust legitimate web pages. An attacker can send a phishing email that contains a link with a legitimate business name in the URL and the user will be redirected from the legitimate web server to any external domain. Users are less likely to notice subsequent redirects to different domains when an authentic URL with a valid SSL certificate can be used within the phishing link.

This type of attack is also a precursor for more serious vulnerabilities such as Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF), Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF), or successful phishing attempts where an attacker can harvest users' credentials or gain users' OAuth access by relaying them through an Open Redirection, to a server they control (and can see the inbound requests from).

**Business Impact**

Unvalidated redirects and forwards can result in reputational damage for the business as customers' trust is negatively impacted by an attacker sending them to a phishing site to extract login credentials, or coercing them to send a financial transaction.

**Steps to Reproduce**

1. Using a browser, navigate to: {{URL}}
1. Copy and modify the URI so that the URL redirects to `url=<http://www.bugcrowd.com/`
1. Submit this in a new browser window and you should be redirected to the Bugcrowd website.

**Proof of Concept (PoC)**

The screenshot below demonstrates the unvalidated redirect or forward executing:

{{screenshot}}

## Resolution
The application should avoid incorporating user-controlled data within redirect targets. This can be achieved by removing the redirect function and replacing it with direct links to the appropriate URL. Additionally, a server-side allow list of trusted URLs can be used as permitted redirect URLs that the website can link to.

It is recommended best practice that all redirects go through an intermediate disclaimer page that notifies the user that they are navigating away from the website.",
